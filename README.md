# YT-view-tracker

Everyone watches a lot of youtube. So what? Well, have you ever watched a video and thought to yourself: "I've definitely seen this before, but I'm not sure when or how many times."
Well that's what my chrome extension is here to help you with! Right now in youtube you can only go to history and see your past youtube viewing history, but nothing
concrete about say, your most viewed video personally. 

Or say you're on a video. How many times have you seen it in the past? Maybe it's a music video that you can't stop playing. Now you can find out!

Youtube's definiton of a view involves a temporal aspect (need to watch a video for a certain amount of time before it counts), as well as many ways of stopping page refreshes from abusing the view system (IP tracking, the 301 views idea, etc.) Also plenty of it is simply unknown to the public, in order to avoid view bots from being successful.

My definition is simple: I will count a page load, or a click on the replay button, as a "view". I think this is simple enough
