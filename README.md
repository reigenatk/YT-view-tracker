# YT-view-tracker

Everyone watches a lot of youtube. So what? Well, have you ever watched a video and thought to yourself: "I've definitely seen this before, but I'm not sure when or how many times."
Well that's what my chrome extension is here to help you with! Right now in youtube you can only go to history and see your past youtube viewing history, but nothing
concrete about say, your most viewed video personally. I think this information would be interesting to see and perhaps nostalgic to know about too!
