*hmmmm*

Everyone watches a lot of youtube. Have you ever watched a video and thought to yourself: "I've definitely seen this before, but I'm not sure when or how many times."

Well that's what my chrome extension is here to help you with! You'd think there would be a feature on youtube that lets you track this info, but right now youtube only gives you a history, no numbers!

There are a few extensions out there that help dim the youtube video if you've seen it before, but as far as I know none currently track the actual amount of views. My Chrome extension uses Chrome local storage system to keep track of when and which videos you watch!

Youtube's definiton of a view involves a temporal aspect (need to watch a video for a certain amount of time before it counts), as well as many ways of stopping page refreshes from abusing the view system (IP tracking, the 301 views idea, etc.) Also plenty of it is simply unknown to the public, in order to avoid view bots from being successful.

My definition is simple: I will count a page load as a "view", refreshes included. I think this is simple enough and will for the most part track the info that people will want to know.
